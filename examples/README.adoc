# Examples

This directory contains example applications using the Hawkular OpenShift Agent.

## Jolokia Wildfly Example

This example installs the Jolokia JVM agent into a Wildfly 10 instance and is configured to expose the Heap Memory Used metric.

Since a Jolokia endpoint exposes a full JMX endpoint, it is essential to make sure that this endpoint is secured under https and also requires authentication to access it.

### Deploying
The link:jolokia-wildfly-example/jolokia-wildfly.yaml[jolokia-wildfly] template can be used to deploy this example:
```
$ oc process -f jolokia-wildfly-example/jolokia-wildfly.yaml | oc create -f -
```

## Prometheus Python Example

This example will start up a simple python application which will expose an unsecured Prometheus endpoint. As an unsecured endpoint, any application can access it without having to be authenticated.

### Deploying
The link:prometheus-python-example/prometheus-python.yaml[prometheus-python] template can be used to deploy this example:
```
$ oc process -f prometheus-python-example/prometheus-python.yaml | oc create -f -
```

# Building the Examples
Each of the example directories contains a `Makefile` which can be used to build the examples.
